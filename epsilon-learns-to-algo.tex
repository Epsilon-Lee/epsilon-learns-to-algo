\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Preface}

This small book is a notebook or diary book recording my roadmap to
learning algorithms and data structures. I would like to first start
from something really interesting and gradually get into the basics
and foundamental infrastructure of the whole algorithm palace.

\begin{quote}
From the beginning of the writing, I am thinking that I am weak in
algorithms and probabily due to education I used to receive while learning
algorithms. So this note is expected to demonstrate experimentally how I educate
myself to be not afraid of and love algorithms. So I hope this note
can be encouraging and educational as well.

\section*{Classic Algorithm Books: A review}\label{classic-algorithm-books-a-review}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Classic Algorithm Books: A review}

In this section, I would like to review several algorithm books. They are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Algorithms} \citep{Dasgupta:2006:ALG:1177299}
\item
  \textbf{Algorithm Design} \citep{Kleinberg:2005:AD:1051910}
\item
  \textbf{Introduction to Algorithms} \citep{Cormen:2009:IAT:1614191}
\end{itemize}

\citet{Dasgupta:2006:ALG:1177299} is a suitable-length book (about 300+ pages) for
quickly getting to grasp the idea of algorithm design and many more
philosophical understanding of a great many algorithms and techniques.
While \citet{Cormen:2009:IAT:1614191} is a gigantic book which includes all the
algorithms of the first two books as well as carefully categorized data
structures like \texttt{binary\ trees}, \texttt{red-black\ trees} and more advanced \texttt{Fibonacci\ heaps}. This book emphasizes on algorithm analysis for which it introduces
several analysis techniques such as \texttt{amortised\ analysis}.
\citet{Kleinberg:2005:AD:1051910} is a very elegant book which I think is similar
to the writing philosophy of \citet{Dasgupta:2006:ALG:1177299}, since both of them
task as example and develop realistic problems to guide the reader into
thinking of delicate algorithms from simple ones.

\hypertarget{intro}{%
\chapter{Start from Something Interests Me}\label{intro}}

This chapter is going to hold several learning experience during
which I get to familiar with something interesting.

\begin{quote}
First principle: to start from something really interests you
so that you would not give up at first when you have not taste
the beauty of the field
\end{quote}

However, to guarantee that those interesting stuff is also classic
or useful from a pragmatic point of view, I would like to first
choose from topics of \href{https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/musings.html}{Donald Knuth's Chritmas Lectures}.

\begin{quote}
Second principle: find the classics to learn from the most well-known
field polit of all the time.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{dancing-links}{%
\section{Dancing Links}\label{dancing-links}}

Dancing links is a data structure proposed as an efficient implementation
of the X algorithm which finds all feasible solutions for an \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_cover}{exact cover}
problem.

In the following, I would like to give a brief introduction to the exact cover
problem with several applications. Most of the current contents are adopted
from the 2018 Christmas Lecture by Donald Knuth.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Exact cover problem, restated in my mathematical wordings;
\item
  The dancing links data structure and its implementation through \texttt{c++}.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{exact-cover-problem}{%
\subsection{Exact Cover Problem}\label{exact-cover-problem}}

Exact cover problem can be mathematically thought of as a set cover problem.
Formally, given a set \(X\) and a subset of its power set \(S \subset 2^X\), find
a subset of \(S' \subset S\), such that \(\forall S'_i \in S\)

\hypertarget{reading-a-book}{%
\chapter{Reading A Book}\label{reading-a-book}}

This chapter is a log of my reading experience of this online free book named \href{https://allendowney.github.io/DSIRP/index.html}{Data Structures and Information Retrieval in Python}, I hope I can gain more practical tips and habits of coding.

\hypertarget{methods}{%
\chapter{Methods}\label{methods}}

We describe our methods in this chapter.
