# Start from Something Interests Me {#intro}

This chapter is going to hold several learning experience during
which I get to familiar with something interesting.

> First principle: to start from something really interests you
so that you would not give up at first when you have not taste
the beauty of the field

However, to guarantee that those interesting stuff is also classic
or useful from a pragmatic point of view, I would like to first
choose from topics of [Donald Knuth's Chritmas Lectures](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/musings.html).

> Second principle: find the classics to learn from the most well-known 
field polit of all the time.
