## Dancing Links

Dancing links is a data structure proposed as an efficient implementation
of the X algorithm which finds all feasible solutions for an [exact cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_cover)
problem.

In the following, I would like to give a brief introduction to the exact cover
problem with several applications. Most of the current contents are adopted 
from the 2018 Christmas Lecture by Donald Knuth.

- Exact cover problem, restated in my mathematical wordings;
- The dancing links data structure and its implementation through `c++`.


### Exact Cover Problem

Exact cover problem can be mathematically thought of as a set cover problem.
Formally, given a set $X$ and a subset of its power set $S \subset 2^X$, find
a subset of $S' \subset S$, such that $\forall S'_i \in S$
